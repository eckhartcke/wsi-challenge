## Reviewer Notes

This is an AngularJS SPA which leverages Backbone and SASS to craft the solution. The app should operate properly when run on any web server.

When, viewed at the sample's resolution of 940x700, this solution should match the sample.

At other sizes, the layout should adapt and be useful. Note that at extreme sizes (extremely large or extremely small), the output is less than perfect.

The solution has some small bugs; I hope that the review finds it acceptable.
